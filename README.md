This uses Node Js to create a web application for uploading files. In my use case this was for uploading items to a remote server that are to be listed on eBay. 

This application currently allows only for image uploads, it is configured to save photos to a folder called "images" and the text from the form data to "uploads".

To run this application, make sure you have node installed on your machine. 

Once installed, open a terminal console on your machine and navigate to the directiry these files are stored in. 

Make sure you have server.js pointed to the correct file paths for your directory. 

run using command "node server.js"
